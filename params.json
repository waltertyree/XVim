{"name":"Xvim","tagline":"Xcode plugin for Vim keybindings","body":"XVim is an open-source Xcode Plug-in that adds [Vim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) keybindings to Xcode.\r\n\r\n#### Demo of Vim's auto indentation with visual mode in Xcode\r\n![demo1](http://imgur.com/xAS5yik.png)\r\n\r\n[Find & Replace demo](http://imgur.com/UezSflH.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstalling XVim is really straight forward:\r\n\r\n* Checkout XVim\r\n\r\n \t`git clone git@github.com:XVimProject/XVim.git`\r\n* Run `make` from XVim's directory.\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\n\r\n### `.xvimrc`\r\n\r\nXvim can use a `.xvimrc` file, which should be located in your `~/` directory. A simple sample file looks simmilar to a `.vimrc`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ni kk <Esc>\r\nset incsearch\r\n\r\n\" Case-insensitive searching.\r\nset ignorecase\r\n\r\n\" But case-sensitive if expression contains a capital letter.\r\nset smartcase\r\n\r\n\" Default to global substitutions on lines\r\nset gdefault\r\n\r\n\" Use the system pasteboard\r\nset pasteboard\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `:xccmd`\r\n\r\nXVim can access Xcode's commands by using the `:xccmd` command. You can then set your preffered commands in your `.xvimrc` file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\" Map <space>b to toggle a breakpoint at the current line\r\nnmap <space>b :xccmd toggleBreakpointAtCurrentLine<CR>\r\n\r\n\" Use <space>cm to toggle comments for the selection\r\nnmap <space>cm :xccmd commentAndUncommentCurrentLines<CR>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n##### 1. Why XVim may not work on a newly released Xcode version?\r\n\r\nXcode releases have different UUIDs, to make **any** Xcode plug-in work, the UUID that the plug-in is using must be updated to match Xcode's. Usually this takes us less than a day, but you can also [do it yourself](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19110899/xcode-plugins-stopped-working).\r\n\r\n##### 2. Why my key mapping doesn't work?\r\n\r\nMaybe your key mapping is clashing with an Xcode key mapping (or even with other plug-in mapping), try to disable them to see if that fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n##### 3. My favorite Vim feature isn't working... Why?\r\n\r\nCheck out XVim's [feature list](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim/blob/master/Documents/Users/FeatureList.md). If you don't find your feature listed there create an [issue](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim/issues/) so that we can work on it.\r\n\r\n## Helping out\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to help out with XVim's development.\r\n\r\n* Open up an [issue](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim/issues) in Github if you find bugs, experience issues or have questions.\r\n* XVim does also support [Bounty Source](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/xvim) in case you want your issue solved faster or just want to donate to the project.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nXVim was created by @JugglerShu on 2012, he is the main project maintainer, he's not very picky with Pull Requests, but try to make them concise. @Goles maintains the website, so if you find anything to be missing just give him a shout.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
